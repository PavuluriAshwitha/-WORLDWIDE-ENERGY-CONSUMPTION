## 🌍 World Wide Energy Consumption – SQL Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes global energy consumption, production, emissions, GDP, and population data to understand the relationship between a country’s economic growth, energy usage, and environmental impact.

By integrating multiple datasets into a relational SQL database, the project provides meaningful insights into global energy trends and sustainability challenges.

## 🎯 Objectives

Build a structured SQL database to store and manage worldwide energy-related data.

Perform SQL queries to uncover patterns in:

Energy consumption & production

CO₂ emissions

GDP growth & population trends

Compare countries on key parameters (GDP, population, emissions).

Analyze time-series trends to measure the impact of population growth and industrialization on energy use.

Provide per capita and ratio-based measures (e.g., emissions per capita, energy-to-GDP ratio).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Database: SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL)
📊 Key Analysis Performed

Total emissions per country (latest year).

Top 5 countries by GDP.

Energy production vs. consumption trends.

Which energy types contribute most to emissions.

Global emission changes year-over-year.

Population growth impact on emissions.

Energy consumption per capita across countries.

Top 10 most populated countries and their emission comparisons.

## ✅ Insights & Findings

A few countries (China, USA, India) account for the majority of global emissions.

Not all highly populated nations are the highest emitters – renewable adoption plays a big role.

Countries with better efficiency & clean energy adoption show lower per capita emissions.

Economic development and industrialization drive both higher energy use and emissions.
## 🚀 Conclusion

This project highlights the urgent need for sustainable energy policies, clean energy adoption, and global cooperation to reduce emissions. Data-driven insights like these can guide policy makers, researchers, and organizations towards a greener and more sustainable future. 🌱
